Version: 0.6.1
+ 0.6.0 about window did not show correct version string

+ lots of internal build process changes


Version: 0.5.9
changes:
+ added more debugs for french OS language
+ release digitally signed with our "Code Signing Certificate" from our own Certificate Authority: setup.exe, ovpn_client.exe and almost all DLLs are signed, libgtk-3-0.dll is not.
+ to verify releases: add our CA to your "Trusted CA" Store and allow purposes only to "codesign" !


Version: 0.5.8
+ fixed app-crash bug on serverwindow reload after config update
+ updated language, countrynames and ms-windows theme

+ all your User Data stored in your install folder: %PROGRAMFILES%\oVPN.to Client for Windows\appdata\ovpn\12345\...

+ user-id selection menu on start: create more user-id folders manually in '%install%\appdata\ovpn\45321'
+ removed server entry from systray: leftclick on systray icon opens serverwindow
+ leftclick systray opens serverwindow and leftclick again sends serverwindow to HIDE (keep window data in memory).
+ hit serverwindow X button to really "destroy" it: open serverwindow again needs milliseconds longer
+ wait ~30s on start for interface to come up
+ fixed option: save apikey in file

+ may be portbale now, if you place a folder "appdata" into extracted 'dist' folder and start open_client.exe as admin manually.
+ fixed problem with systraymenu not working after updating to new Sweden Servers because of missing countryname for group...
you can fix problem by deleting files SE1.ovpn.to.ovpn + SE2.ovpn.to.ovpn from '%appdata%\ovpn\xxxxx\openvpn\config\' -> folders 'ip4' and 'ip46/' and don't update configs anymore... bug of sudden death!
